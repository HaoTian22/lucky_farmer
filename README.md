# Introduction
This is the readme file for the **Lucky Farmer** board game calculator.

Lucky Farmer is a strategy game that involves growing and harvesting crops. We created this calculator because we found the calculations in the game to be boring and complex.

Traditionally, players were required to perform a series of calculations every minute, which detracted from the strategic aspect of the game. We developed this computer calculator to enhance the players' enjoyment and allow them to focus more on the game strategy.

# Getting Started
To start playing Lucky Farmer, follow these steps:

1. Game Setup:
   - Download the [calculator](/lucky_farmer.py) and run it using Python, or visit the [website](https://lucky-farmer.haotian22.top) (recommended).
   - Refer to the end of the [rules](/rules.md) file to ensure you have all the necessary cards ready.

2. Gameplay:
   - Familiarize yourself with the rules of the game.
   - We acknowledge that understanding all the rules at once can be challenging, so we are working on improving the user's guidance.

Enjoy your game! ðŸ˜Š
